# 👋 Hi, I'm Taylan

> From “How does this work?” to building the systems that do.

I've always been driven by a need to understand what's happening beneath the surface. That mindset naturally pulled me into infrastructure engineering, where I can focus on building the resilient, invisible layers that empower teams to move fast and safely, especially in SaaS environments.

My goal is to design systems that scale, and I enjoy sharing what I learn from the field at [blog.taylan.dev](https://blog.taylan.dev).

### Philosophy & Focus
* ⚙️ **Resilient Infrastructure:** Designing systems that are robust, scalable, and fault-tolerant.
* 🚀 **Developer Velocity:** Building platforms and CI/CD pipelines that enable teams to ship with confidence.
* 🔬 **Deep Observability:** Believing that you can't fix what you can't see.
* ⚡ **My Mantra:** *"Is this how it works?"* — a reminder to keep questioning, learning, and iterating.
